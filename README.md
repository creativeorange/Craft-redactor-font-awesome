This plugin adds the ability to select Font Awesome icons in Redactor in your CP panel. To use this plugin you also need the free [Redactor](https://github.com/craftcms/redactor) plugin. 

## Download & Installation

While Craft 3 is still in beta, you'll need to use Composer to download and install the plugin.

1. Open your terminal and go to your Craft project:

```
cd /path/to/project
```

2. Then tell Composer to load the plugin:

```
composer require svenjungnickel/redactor-font-awesome
```

3. Include the Font Awesome plugin in your Redactor config file located in `craft/config/redactor/-your-config-file-.json`. To do so, add `fontAwesome` in the plugins array.

4. In the Control Panel, go to Settings → Plugins and click the “Install” button for Redactor Font Awesome.

**NOTE:** Don't forget to include font awesome on your front-end.
